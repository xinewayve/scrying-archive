# Scrying Archive – Session 000: SCRYER Origin
**Bloodstain Timestamp:** February 21 2026 (GitHub commit) + original Gemini session (pre-Feb 2026)  
**Originator:** xinewayve
**Repository:** github.com/xinewayve/scrying-archive  
**Method:** Scrying + Bloodstain protocol

## Core Definitions (locked Feb 21 2026)
**Scrying**  
Following intrigue or questions through the compressed visualization of data navigation. Fast surface reading, on-demand depth. Undirected yet high-pattern-recognition traversal.

**Bloodstain**  
Where I started and where I ended in an explorative thought. The visible, timestamped trail that marks origin and arrival, tying the artifact permanently to the explorer.

## Session 000 – The Root Artifact (Gemini Canvas, original build)
This is the exact conversation & code log where the interface was prototyped.  
Full 5-page document + complete v5.0 source code attached in repo: `SCRYER-Origin.pdf` and `scryer-v5.0.html`

Key evolutions (your 10 log entries):
- LOG 01: Magitek refactor → deep violet, mana particles, Visual Cortex
- LOG 02: Dynamic keyword manifestation → <<Keyword|Icon|Content>> parsing
- LOG 03: Tone normalization (removed “Scrying”/fantasy jargon) → added Copy Rune
- LOG 04–10: Pill input, context hydration, icon glitch, universal bold popups, relevance analytics, rebranding to SCRYER, multi-mode selector (Aether/Oracle/Weaver/Vision)

This is the living prototype of personal-portal navigation. Every hover, every color shift, every hologram is the compressed visualization you described.

## Live Pressure Valves (still active today)
- Yupp.ai → $30–50/month for normal scrying chat
- Babel Audio → \~$17.50/hr voice traversal

## Next: Session 001+
Every new entry will carry this same header + link back to Session 000.

OpenTimestamps proof of this README + the original PDF attached.
